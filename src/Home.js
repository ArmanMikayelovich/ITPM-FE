            <p>IT project management (ITPM) is the process of managing the plan,
                organization, and accountability to achieve information technology goals.</p>
            <p> Since the reach of IT spans across most of a business or enterprise,
                the scope of these projects can be large and complex.</p>
            <p>The magnitude of IT project management often means that itâ€™s more than just
                applying knowledge, aligning skills, and using regular tools and techniques to drive
                a project to completion.</p>
